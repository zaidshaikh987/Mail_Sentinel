"""
The vendored knowledge base: the IANA cipher-suite registry and the rule base.

Two deliberate choices here, both learned the hard way.

**This file exists.** Without it the directory is a *namespace* package, whose
module spec has ``origin is None``. On Python 3.9 —  the version Apple ships
with the macOS Command Line Tools, so a very common one to be handed —
``importlib.resources.files()`` resolves a package by doing:

    package_directory = pathlib.Path(spec.origin).parent

which on a namespace package is ``pathlib.Path(None)``:

    TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not NoneType

Python 3.10 and newer handle namespace packages there, so the failure appears
only on 3.9 — and the whole engine dies on the first capture with a traceback
that says nothing about the actual cause. It also made a container and a laptop
behave differently while running byte-identical code, because the container's
Python happened to be newer.

**The files are located relative to ``__file__``, not through
``importlib.resources``.** Adding this file is enough to fix 3.9, but the
version-sensitive API buys us nothing: ``importlib.resources`` exists to read
data out of zipped imports, and this engine is always installed as real files —
editable from a checkout, or unpacked from a wheel. Locating them the plain way
removes an entire class of version-dependent behaviour, and it matches how the
other two data directories (``report/templates`` and ``ml/artifacts``) have
always been found.
