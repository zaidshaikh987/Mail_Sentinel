"""
The engine's process boundary, run as a real subprocess.

This is not a user interface — the web UI is the only interface. It is the
contract the Spring Boot backend speaks, so these tests run the exact commands
the backend issues.

Why this file exists
--------------------
Every other test imports the engine into the pytest process, and that turned out
to hide a whole class of bug. ``certs.py`` once reached a submodule through
``__import__("cryptography").hazmat.primitives.serialization``, which only
resolves if something else has already imported that submodule. Under pytest
something always had — ``test_certificates.py`` imports ``serialization``
itself — so the suite passed while a bare ``python -m mailsentinel.cli`` run
crashed on every capture containing a certificate.

The suite was passing for the wrong reason. Running the CLI in a clean
interpreter is the only way to catch that, and it is also exactly how the Spring
Boot backend invokes the engine, so this file tests the real integration path.
